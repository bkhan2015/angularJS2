Commit you code through command line code into Git bash

Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
$git init

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
$git add .

Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. 
To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
$git commit -m "First commit"

In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
$git remote add origin [remote repository URL]

Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
If you are working in your office computer, please setup proxy as below:
$Git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@[host Name]:[port]
$Git config --global https.proxy https://user:password@[Host Name]:[port]
$Git config --global http.sslVerify false

Then push your code into repository.
But before you push your code pull latest code from remote repository URL
$git pull [remote repository URL]

# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
$git push origin master
